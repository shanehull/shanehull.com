Shane Hull's personal website built on Hugo, with a twist.

**Pages:**

- About: A little about me
- Books: A list of (mostly) Lindy books
- Quotes: A random quote generator for a daily nugget of wisdom
- Blog: One day I'll actually post some thoughts..

**Development:**

The `air` config has everything needed to build the Hugo site and serve it, along with the custom handlers for the hypermedia APIs.
