I am an Engineer with a decade of experience across DevOps, Systems and Cloud with a focus on Kubernetes and the Cloud-Native ecosystem.

When I'm not wrangling a terminal, I’m likely buried in an epub. I’m still holding out for that floor-to-ceiling mahogany bookcase, but for now, my digital library keeps my curiosity fed.

I manage a private investment portfolio with a long-term view, applying the same curiosity to value investing that I do to distributed systems. Since 2017, I have consistently outperformed the market by a healthy margin by "turning over rocks" and finding value in inefficient corners of the market.

At my core, I'm a bottom-up thinker, dabbler and tinkerer.
