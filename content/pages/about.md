I am an Engineer with 7+ years of experience across DevOps, Systems and Cloud with a focus on Kubernetes and the Cloud-Native ecosystem.

Go is my hammer of choice, and all problems thus far look like a nail (okay, I joke).

I am an avid reader. My #1, all-time dream is to own a bookcase so I can look cool in meetings, but for now, I'm condemned to a life of epubs.

You can find me on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/shanehull0" target="_blank">LinkedIn</a> or <a href="https://twitter.com/shed_one" target="_blank">X</a>.
