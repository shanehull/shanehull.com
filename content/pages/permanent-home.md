# A permanent home for your business

I am a Melbourne-based engineer with a decade of experience at the intersection of engineering and operations.

My goal is to transition from short-term "fixer" to long-term ownership. I am looking to acquire resilient, profitable operations and ensure their success for decades to come.

## My approach

I am an individual, not a private equity firm or a broker. I am focused on long-term stewardship. I am interested in businesses that dominate an essential niche and possess a documented history of stability. I do not seek speculative growth; I value quality cash flows and durability.

**Stability > Growth**

## Why me?

- **Engineering DNA:** I see business through the same lens I see distributed systems: I care about efficiency, durability, and the "plumbing" that makes a company work.
- **Permanent Capital:** I am an individual builder. I am looking for a legacy to build upon, not a company to flip or strip. My timeline is measured in decades.
- **Reliable Stewardship:** Whether you are looking for a complete exit or a partner to maintain the engine you've built, I offer a safe, technical pair of hands for your customers and your legacy.

## What I am looking for

I am looking for quality acquisitions that meet the following criteria:

- **Financials:** Consistently profitable with a history of stable, verifiable cash flows (typically $100k – $500k SDE / EBIT).
- **Industry:** Essential niches—ranging from logic-heavy B2B services and industrial software to resilient, local cash-flow operations.
- **Customer Base:** High retention or steady, recurring demand.
- **Transition:** I am flexible on the timeline. I care about who takes over the keys and want to see the business thrive long after the handover.

If you have built a durable business and are considering a succession plan, I would welcome a confidential conversation.
