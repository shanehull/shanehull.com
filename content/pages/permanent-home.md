# Seeking a permanent home for your business?

I am a Melbourne-based engineer with a decade of experience at the intersection of engineering and operations.

I'm looking to maximize my agency by transitioning from a short-term "fixer" in the DevOps space to a long-term owner-operator. My goal is to find a resilient business, buy it, and run it indefinitely.

## My approach

I am an individual, not a private equity firm or a broker. I am looking for a single mission for the next 20+ years. I am interested in businesses that dominate an essential niche and possess a documented history of stability. I do not seek speculative growth; I value quality cash flows and long-term durability.

**Stability > Growth**

## Why me?

- **Engineering DNA:** I see business through the same lens I see distributed systems: I care about efficiency, durability, and what makes it tick.
- **Permanent Capital:** I am an individual, not a private equity firm. I’m looking for a legacy to build upon, not a company to flip.
- **Direct Stewardship:** I’m looking for a single mission for the next 20 years. If you’re a founder looking to step back, I offer a safe pair of hands for your customers and your legacy.

## What I am looking for

I am looking for a single acquisition that meets the following criteria:

- **Financials:** Consistently profitable with a history of stable cash flows (typically $200k – $1M SDE/EBIT).
- **Industry:** Logic-heavy niches, B2B services, or industrial software.
- **Customer Base:** High retention and low churn. I value businesses that are "essential" to their customers' daily operations.
- **Transition:** An owner looking to exit over the next 6–12 months who cares about the long-term continuity of their team.

If you have built a durable business and are considering a succession plan, I would welcome a confidential conversation.
