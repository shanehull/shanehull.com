A reverse DCF model that works backwards from a stock's current price to solve for the implied growth rate the market is pricing in. Instead of valuing a company, it reveals what growth assumptions must be true for the stock to be fairly valued at its current price.

Input the stock price, starting cash flow, hold period, exit multiple, and discount rate. The reverse DCF calculator solves for the implied growth rate that makes the math work. Use this to stress-test your bull case and see if market expectations are realistic.
