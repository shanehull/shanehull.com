Models levered returns to equity on an SMB acquisition using bank debt and/or seller financing. Accounts for dual debt sources, annual debt service, corporate and capital gains taxes, and exit proceeds. Tracks payback period and entry/exit leverage to validate deal structure.

Build your deal by specifying purchase price, financing split, debt terms, operating performance assumptions, and exit thesis. The calculator shows your IRR, money multiple, and whether the capital structure is realistic (entry leverage typically shouldn't exceed 4x Debt/SDE).
