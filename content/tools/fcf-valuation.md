Values a resource project (mine, oil field, etc.) by modeling annual production volumes, commodity prices, operating costs, and capital expenditure. Discounts the project cashflows back to present value to calculate NPV and IRR.

Build a mine-by-mine or project-by-project model. Input production schedule, commodity prices, costs, and capex. The calculator compares the NPV across different discount rates and shows whether the project creates value above your required return.
