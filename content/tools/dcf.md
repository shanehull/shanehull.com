A discounted cash flow (DCF) valuation model that projects free cash flows over a holding period, then discounts them back to present value at your required rate of return. Assumes constant growth and a terminal exit multiple. The model produces an intrinsic stock value estimate independent of current market price.

Input starting cash flow, growth rate, hold period, exit multiple, and discount rate. Compare the calculated intrinsic value to the current stock price to assess upside/downside potential and margin of safety.
