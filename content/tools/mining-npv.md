Calculates the net present value (NPV) of a mining project or capital investment by discounting all future cashflows back to today at your required discount rate. Positive NPV means the mining project or asset creates value; negative NPV means it destroys value. A simpler alternative to building a full DCF valuation model.

Enter your expected annual cashflows and discount rate. The NPV calculator computes the net present value and shows you at a glance whether the mining asset or capital project is worth acquiring or investing in at a given price.
