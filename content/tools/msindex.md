The Misesian Stationarity Index is a financial metric that measures the deviation of the equity-to-net-worth ratio from its geometric mean over time. This indicator can help identify periods of economic anomaly or instability.

The calculation divides each period's equity-to-net-worth ratio by the geometric mean of all previous ratios, providing a stationary measure that adjusts for long-term trends.
