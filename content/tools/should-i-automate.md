An automation calculator that determines the break-even threshold for automating a repetitive task. It compares the time and cost of building automation against the cumulative time you'll save over a given period. Automating something that costs less in labor time than it takes to build is a bad investment in automation.

Input the task duration, frequency, and your hourly rate. The automation break-even calculator shows the maximum hours you should spend automating—spend less and you're ahead; spend more and you've over-engineered.
